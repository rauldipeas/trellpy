# Trello Desktop App - based on PytQt6

This is a simple PyQt6 wrap for Trello WebApp, my project manager app of choice.
They do not have a Linux Desktop yet so I created one.

## Install on Ubuntu 24.04 / Debian 13 (GNOME/Wayland)

```bash
bash "$PWD"/build_deb.sh
sudo apt install --reinstall "$PWD"/dist/trellpy*.deb
```
